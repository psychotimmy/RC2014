Last updated 22nd January 2023

1. Advent of Code 2021-25 - an implementation of the puzzle solution that will run on Z80 BASIC Ver 4.7b (see also the Sharp MZ-700 repository: https://github.com/psychotimmy/Sharp-MZ-700).

2. Sunset / sunrise calculator for a given latitude / longitude on a particular date. Minimal changes to the version published in Sky & Telescope https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-resources/basic-programs-from-sky-telescope/ so that it will run on the RC2014 4.7b BASIC (' statements becomes REM, PRINT USING becomes PRINT).

3. Primes program, written using Turbo Pascal 3.0 under CP/M 2.2
